# Overview

TestBox is a next generation testing framework for ColdFusion (CFML) that is based on BDD (Behavior Driven Development) for providing a clean obvious syntax for writing tests. It contains not only a testing framework, runner, assertions, mocking/stubbing and expectations library. It also supports xUnit style of testing with MXUnit compatibilities.

> **Important** TestBox is a standalone testing package and is meant to be used with **any** ColdFusion (CFML) application, framework or library.  IT IS NOT ONLY FOR COLDBOX APPLICATIONS.
