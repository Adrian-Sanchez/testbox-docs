# System Requirements

MockBox has been designed to work under the following CFML Engines:

* Railo 3.1+
* Lucee 4.5+
* Adobe ColdFusion 9+
* Write capabilities on disk for the default path of `/{mockbox}/system/testings/stubs`. You can also choose the directory destination for stub creations yourself when you initialize MockBox. If using ColdFusion 9 or Railo you can even use `ram://` and use the virtual file system.
