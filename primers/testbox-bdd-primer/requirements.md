# Requirements

TestBox does not depend on any other framework for operation and it has a clean and descriptive syntax that will make you giggle when writing your tests. It ships with not only the xUnit and BDD testing capabilities, but also an assertions and expectations library, several different runners, reporters and MockBox, for mocking and stubbing capabilities.
